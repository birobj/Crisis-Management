        <h1>Pre-Event Phase</h1>
        <p>To ensure the development and maintenance of a competent crisis response apparatus, law enforcement agencies must take certain steps as a matter of routine operations before a critical incident occurs. The benefits of such preparation will be evident during the unexpected incident or planned events such as search warrant and arrest operations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Crisis Response Plan</h2>
        <p>Agencies must have a current Crisis Response Plan (CRP) which is a set of pre-established procedures which informs and guides actions during a crisis situation. Supplemental information provides additional details to support crisis site-specific or act-specific incidents. The CRP must be periodically updated (the FBI suggests every three years) and posted to all applicable personnel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Crisis Management Training</h2>
        <p>Critical to maintenance of the CRP is the practice of its procedures. Planned exercises of all the components and activities dictated in the plan reinforce crisis response procedure and identify areas for improvement. Tabletop Exercises, Command Post Exercises, and Full Scale Exercises are some vehicles for this training. Frequent participation prepares the leadership and crisis staff for actual crisis management.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In addition, Command Post (CP) personnel and office staff must be trained and practiced in its use. The training should include regularly scheduled opportunities to practice Command Post set up, information flow in the CP, the use of appropriate information management systems, and the use of specialized software and resources that might be used in a CP environment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Crisis Management Coordinator</h2>
        <p>The Crisis Management Coordinator (CMC) is the central figure in preparation and execution for critical incidents, special events and exercises. The CMC should be a sworn law enforcement officer and supervisor who understands investigative operations and has daily access to other supervisors and executive management.</p>

        <h1>Immediate Response Checklist</h1>
        <p>This phase of a crisis may occur in escalating steps beginning with the initial notification to the agency. It marks a commitment to respond for assessment and management of a crisis situation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The Crisis Management Team (CMT) should consist of the CMC and personnel from the Operations Group of the Command Post (CP), including coordinators of the following units:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Command Post Operations Group
        <ul><li>Intake</li>
        <li>Investigations</li>
        <li>Intelligence</li></ul></li>
        <li>Tactical (SWAT)</li>
        <li>Negotiations</li>
        <li>Technical</li>
        <li>Surveillance</li>
        <li>Evidence Response</li>
        <li>WMD/HazMat Response</li>
        <li>Bomb Technicians</li>
		</ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An early decision to activate the Command Post or Emergency Operations Center (CP/EOC) will positively affect command, control, and communications at this crucial stage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Determine if crisis involves potential or actual WMD (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high explosive) or Hazardous Material</li>
        <li>Determine if your CRP has an annex, contingency plan, or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for this situation. If so, use it</li>
        <li>If appropriate, advise personnel to respond to a designated staging area for initial assessment and assignment</li>
        <li>If crisis involves WMD or HazMat, ensure a risk assessment is completed prior to deploying assets to the scene. Ensure proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is donned before deploying to the scene</li>
        <li>Brief and deploy investigative and field response teams from the predesignated staging area</li>
        <li>Alert CP/EOC personnel to respond and activate CP/EOC operations at designated location
		<ul><li>Event log</li>
		<li>Investigation management or lead tracking software</li>
		<li>CP supplies such as forms, flip charts, etc.</li></ul></li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Specific incident planning checklists can be found later in this book for the following critical incident scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Tactical/SWAT</li>
        <li>Bomb Threats</li>
        <li>WMD Checklist</li>

        <li>Control of the crisis site</li>
        <li>Negotiations</li>
        <li>Intelligence gathering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With these elements intact, the crisis management team can begin implementation of tactical plans, evidence recovery, or HazMat/WMD operations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Resolution Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Avoid the Action Imperative
        <ul><li>Is it necessary?
        <ul><li>Is it necessary now?</li></ul></li>
        <li>Is it risk effective</li>
        <li>Is it legal and ethical</ul></li></li>
        <li>Have all reasonable options been exhausted</li>
        <li>Document efforts to implement these options</li>
        <li>Obtain authorization for assault from superiors (if necessary)</li>
        <li>Have SWAT, Negotiators, and Investigators developed an appropriate surrender plan</li>
        <li>Are the hostage holding areas and prisoner processing facilities ready to commence operations</li>
        <li>Are evidence technicians prepared for crime scene investigation</li>
        <li>Conduct liaison with appropriate agencies/offices (Other law enforcement agencies, prosecuting authorities, medical facilities, mayor/politicians, fire and emergency services, media representatives)
        <ul><li>Contact negotiators to determine latest intelligence or change in circumstances</li>
        <li>Make final coordination with CP/EOC units</li>
        <li>Do you still possess the element of surprise</li>
        <li>Make “hand-off” of operational control to tactical leader and advise personnel of “hand-off”</li>
        <li>Issue compromise authority to tactical leader</li>
        <li>Continuously monitor negotiations and other intelligence sources</li>
        <li>Recall tactical team if situation changes and can be resolved without an assault</li>
        <li>Are victim witness assets prepared to assist</li>
        <li>Coordinate and authorize a crisis evacuation plan with tactical team leader for the following categories
        <ul><li>Hostages</li>
        <li>Wounded</li>
        <li>Subject(s)</li>
        <li>Tactical Team</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Following the resolution of a critical incident, it is necessary to maintain control of the crisis site until all elements have completed their work and accounted for all personnel and equipment. Coordination with other agencies before standing down the operation will ensure that all concerns relative to the crisis are met while the area is still under agency control.</p>

        <h1>Command Post/Emergency Op. Center</h1>
        <p>Command Posts are commonly established to monitor and manage a variety of matters, to include critical incidents, major investigations and/or special events. They may be staffed by a combination of local, state, and federal authorities for any type of investigative matter or event. The Incident Commander (IC) is often the highest-ranking law enforcement officer of the agency with primary jurisdiction, but it can be delegated down to a law enforcement officer as needed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A command post can be utilized when the law enforcement agency is acting alone or when leading a task force, including drug or gang raids, child abductions, or local special events.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is utilized when a terrorism, WMD, or significant criminal threat or incident warrants a major cooperative effort. A EOC may be established and staffed in a watch mode in support of significant special events, allowing for rapid expansion to full operational mode should a critical incident occur requiring a full response.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Wisconsin Emergency Management (WEM) operates the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC), which can coordinate and request additional regional or even national assets.</p>

        <h2>Command Group</h2>
        <p>The Command Group is led by the senior law enforcement officer of the agency with jurisdiction over the incident—it may be the Police Chief, Sheriff, Incident Commander (IC), Special Agent in Charge (SAC), or in their absence, their designee.  The Command Group also includes the Crisis Management Coordinator (CMC), Media Representative, and senior decision maker representatives of partner agencies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Police Chief, Sheriff, SAC, or his/her designee, is responsible for the overall activity relating to the critical incident or major investigation to include developing strategic goals and objectives, directing law enforcement activities, and coordinating with other agency decision makers.</p>

        <h1>Operations Group</h1>
        <p>The Operations Group is the primary group responsible for processing information and intelligence and moving the investigation to a successful conclusion. In CP/EOC floor plan diagrams, the coordinators of Intake, Investigation, and Intelligence are physically located close to one another to facilitate the rapid and continuous flow of information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a very large CP/EOC operation, the IC will consider designating someone as the Operations Coordinator to strengthen horizontal and vertical communication.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Intake Unit</h2>
        <p>Intake is responsible for receiving, assessing, and documenting new information. Information may come into the CP/EOC in a variety of ways, to include telephone calls, E-mails, facsimiles, mail and internal documents. The Intake Component is the central point for receiving incoming information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Intake Unit</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Documents incoming information</li>
        <li>Assesses if the information has already been reported</li>
        <li>Assesses the relevance of the information</li>
        <li>Disseminates the information as appropriate</li>
        </ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is imperative to continually evaluate the ability of the component to handle the flow of information and modify staffing and assignments to permit efficient receipt and assessment of incoming information. If a press conference is scheduled, additional call takers may be required to properly staff Intake so no citizen tips are missed due to an increase in call volume after the press conference.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Intelligence Unit</h2>
        <p>Intelligence is responsible for providing intelligence requirements, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination processes that support the CP/EOC operation and the greater intelligence community.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Intelligence Unit</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Manages the collection, analysis, archiving and dissemination of investigative and strategic intelligence</li>
        <li>Prepares intelligence briefs and assessments as requested or necessary</li>
        <li>Performs the Intelligence Requirements and Collection Management (IRCM) function</li>
        <li>Identifies and resolves any intelligence gaps</li>
        <li>Supports the operational and tactical intelligence needs of the IC and CP/EOC operations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Intelligence Coordinator is responsible for coordinating and establishing the flow of intelligence within the CP/EOC, tracking and resolving all intelligence-related leads, and maintaining situational awareness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Situation boards are used to provide an orderly, visual display of key data to all participants. The number of situation boards depends on the nature of the incident. The following are examples of situation board topics that may be used:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="boardbox">
        <div class="half left">Subjects</div>
        <div class="half right">Hostages</div>
        <div class="half left">Weapons</div>
        <div class="half right">Crisis Site</div>
        <div class="half left">Maps/ Photos</div>
        <div class="half right">Perimeter Locations</div>
        <div class="half left">Deadlines</div>
        <div class="half right">Demands</div>
        <div class="half left">Shift Schedules</div>
        <div class="half right">Weather</div>
        <div class="half left">Operations Order</div>
        <div class="half right">Chain of Command</div>
        <div class="half left">Time Line</div>
        <div class="half right">Directory</div>
        <div class="half left">Briefing Schedule</div>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        </div>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Situational awareness is also maintained with the use of electronic tools such as Law Enforcement Online (LEO) Virtual Command Center (VCC), E-Sponder, and other programs.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Investigations Unit</h2>
        <p>The Investigations Unit is responsible for the overall direction of the substantive investigation. The Investigations Unit must ensure the investigative process is thorough and appropriate, which includes overseeing the investigative support entities’ activities that are being performed on behalf of or at the direction of the agency.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Investigations Unit</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Reviews all information of investigative significance and briefs the Command Group regarding new developments</li>
        <li>Ensures that leads are set and tracked and investigative results are evaluated for possible further action</li>
        <li>Maintains the case file associated with the investigation</li></ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Field Deployed Assets</h2>
        <p>A representative of each field deployed team (special mission team) is placed in the CP/EOC to provide immediate subject matter expertise to the Command Group and the Operations Group members. These representatives should have a direct communication link with their field deployed teams and should be conversant in the terminology, tactics, techniques, and procedures of these field deployed special mission teams. They should also have access to the crisis information management system so they can retrieve information that is useful to their field deployed teams and forward the rest of the CP/EOC information provided from their field deployed team.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Common field deployed teams include SWAT, Negotiators, Bomb Technicians, Evidence Collection, Surveillance, and Technical Surveillance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Field Deployed Asset representative</p>
		<ul>
        <li>Acts as the coordination point between the CP/EOC and special mission team operations in the field</li>
		<li>Must have experience in the area he/she is representing</li>

        <h1>Operations Support Group</h1>
        <p>The Operations Support Group positions are staffed by coordinators who provide advice and assistance within their respective areas of expertise, such as Operational Medicine, Victim/Witness Coordinators, Communications, Administrative/ Logistics/Liaison and Information Management.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Consequence Management Group (EOC Only)</h2>
        <p>Consequence Management positions are staffed by representatives from federal, military, state, local and private sector organizations and agencies with expertise in non-traditional law enforcement matters. These representatives provide recovery focused expertise in support of law enforcement activities. The Consequence Management Group will be incorporated into the EOC or the SEOC.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Law enforcement managers should ensure an understanding with consequence management/recovery representatives is in place to ensure investigative information that is restricted, law enforcement sensitive, and/or subject to rules of evidence or court orders is not inadvertently released by consequence management representatives or their headquarters unaware of law enforcement dissemination restrictions.</p>

        <h1>Tactical</h1>
        <p>Law enforcement agencies must designate how and when they will obtain the assistance of tactical (SWAT) team(s) when needed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Each SWAT team must be directed by a SWAT Team Leader. The Team Leader will maintain direct tactical command of the team during all operational deployments. During operations, the SWAT Team Leader will report to the IC at the crisis site.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A SWAT Coordinator should be appointed as the SWAT representative in the Command Post during operations. This person may be charged with the responsibility to serve as the IC and be familiar with team capabilities.</li>
		<li>The SWAT Coordinator should be an individual who has previously served as a SWAT member and has a good working knowledge of tactics, techniques, and procedures, but is no longer a SWAT team member</li>
		</ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Utilization of SWAT</h2>
        <p>A raid, arrest, search warrant or other situation posing a higher-than-normal risk may necessitate the use of a SWAT team to reduce the risk to officers, innocent persons, and subjects.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The determination as to whether a given situation meets “higher-than-normal risk” criteria will be made by the appropriate supervisor based upon an assessment of various factors, including the following:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Hostages (if any)—number, location, medical histories, etc.</li>
        <li>Objective (crisis site)—location, defensibility, size, configuration, avenues of approach, etc.</li>
        <li>Weapons—types, numbers, lethality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The FBI recommends that SWAT team use be required if a proposed operation contains any of the following hazardous situations:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Suspects wanted for armed assault on an officer</li>
        <li>Automatic weapons believed to be on the premises</li>
        <li>Hostage believed to be at the location</li>
        <li>Heavily barricaded location (e.g., sally port, internal fortifications, multiple gates, etc.)</li>
        <li>Weapons of Mass Destruction believed to be on premises</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Additionally, the FBI suggests SWAT team use should be required when a proposed operation contains three or more of the following hazardous situations:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Barred doors and windows</li>
        <li>Guard dogs</li>
        <li>“Third Strike” subject</li>
        <li>Violent criminal history (armed violence against public or law enforcement)</li>
        <li>Handguns at the location</li>
        <li>Threats by suspect against law enforcement</li>
        <li>Countersurveillance (e.g. closed circuit TV, intrusion devices, etc.)</li>
        <li>Warrant to be executed in a neighborhood deemed potentially volatile or non-compliant</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>If a proposed operation contains two of the hazards listed above, the FBI recommends contacting the SWAT team leader to determine if there is a need for SWAT involvement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the event the IC chooses to exercise a tactical option, command and control of the SWAT team will pass from the IC to the Team Leader at a clearly defined point. Should the situation change the IC can halt the tactical teams at any of the phase lines. The teams can also be recalled if an extended delay is anticipated.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Phase Lines</h2>
        <p>Phase lines are geographic locations established within the tactical operations order which are used during an assault to control the SWAT team’s movement to the crisis site. The FBI uses the following standards:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Phase Line Red</strong> - SWAT team’s staging/holding area.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Phase Line Yellow</strong> - SWAT team’s last point of cover and concealment and the point at which the SWAT Coordinator or SWAT Team Leader will request compromise authority from the IC, if appropriate for the operation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Phase Line Green</strong> - SWAT team’s point of entry (breach point) into the crisis location.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Compromise Authority</h2>
        <p>In conjunction with the Team Leader’s assumption of command and control of tactical assets, the IC must grant Compromise Authority to the TL when the situation requires it. This allows the TL to make the determination if the assault should continue or be aborted in the event the tactical elements are discovered by the subject(s) prior to reaching the planned execution point. Compromise authority is generally necessary only when hostage lives are endangered as a result of hostage takers becoming aware of an imminent assault to rescue hostages.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Tactical Reference Codes</h2>
        <p>Various methods are used to provide a common frame of reference in reporting activity around a target location. The four sides of a structure, vehicle, or vessel are labeled with colors, letters, or numbers to designate their location.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation uses colors: White (front), Black (rear), Red (right), and Green (left).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Law Enforcement Standards Board “Tactical Response” academy curriculum teaches the clockwise use of letters, starting with “A” (front), “B” (left), “C” (rear), and “D” (right).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Law Enforcement Standards Board “Tactical Response” academy curriculum teaches the clockwise use of letters, starting with “A” (front), “B” (left), “C” (rear), and “D” (right).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <img src="css-images/tactical-ref-codes.png" alt="Tactical Reference Codes Diagram" class="center"/>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Agencies may use a clockwise numbering system, starting with “1” (front), “2” (left), “3” (rear), and “4” (right).  Or, agencies may use another system.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It’s vital that the SWAT Coordinator, Team Leader, and officers clearly understand whatever tactical reference code is used, and use the same terminology.</p>

        <h1>Emergency Assault Plan</h1>
        <p>The Emergency Assault Plan (EAP) is an immediate measure designed to regain control or stabilize a rapidly deteriorating crisis situation that poses imminent danger to the lives of innocent people. It generally lacks contingency planning, preparation, rehearsal, and full use of tactical capabilities. Consequently, execution of the EAP presents a high level of risk to all concerned. <strong><em>EAP approval authority rests with the IC.</em></strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Establish the EAP as soon as possible after the crisis occurs.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Movement of officers to crisis site</li>
        <li>Breaching</li>

        <li>Handling of hostages and subjects</li>

        <h1>Deliberate Assault Plan</h1>
        <p>The Deliberate Assault Plan (DAP) encompasses tactics developed to accomplish crisis resolution. Unlike the EAP, the timetable and sequence for implementation are controlled by the IC. It is characterized by intelligence driven planning, contingencies, rehearsals, modification and risk assessment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Prepare and brief initial plan as soon as possible after the mission has been identified</li>
        <li>Identify multiple breach points to ensure surprise, security and positive entry</li>
        <li>Sniper/observer team coverage during all possible phases</li>
        <li>Plan must completely neutralize the threat</li>
        <li>Prevent subject(s) escape, limit potential to react</li>
        <li>Safe evacuation of hostages and subjects</li>
        <li>Preservation of evidence</li>

        <h1>Tactical Devices</h1>
        <p><em>Various tactical devices are discussed below. Agencies should give consideration to the points raised, and pre-plan the criteria for use, authorization required, and follow-up reporting requirements.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Diversionary Devices (Flashbangs)</h2>
        <p>Only authorized flashbangs should be used. Flashbangs are not grenades or stun weapons. Their purpose is to distract, disorient and create an uncontrollable physiological/psychological response from the subject(s) through an audible and visual report. This diversion is utilized by the tactical team to cover their action and maintain, regain or enhance the element of surprise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Policy:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Pre-plan whose approval is required before use</li>
        <li>Life threatening situation</li>
        <li>When used will reduce the risk of serious injury or death to
		<ul><li>Hostages</li>
        <li>Officers</li>
        <li>Other individuals</li></ul></li>
		<li>Deployed by officers trained in use and wearing protective clothing (eye protection, gloves)</li></ul>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Number of people in immediate area of deployment</li>
        <li>Age and health considerations (infants/elderly) of individuals in site</li>
        <li>Risk to innocent parties</li>
        <li>Presence of hazardous or combustible materials</li>
		</ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Shotgun Breaching</h2>
        <p>Some SWAT teams do not possess explosive breaching capability. Shotgun breaching may be adopted in incidents where other mechanical breaching methods would be ineffective. Only shotgun rounds designed for breaching and approved by the agency should be utilized for this purpose.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Policy:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Pre-plan whose approval is required before use</li>
        <li>Subject(s) pose an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to
        <ul><li>Hostages</li>
        <li>Officers</li>
        <li>Other individuals</li></ul>
        <li>Utilized by trained personnel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Number and location of person(s) inside crisis site</li>
        <li>Factors determining risk of primary and secondary fragmentation</li>
        <li>Potential for success using this technique</li>
        <li>Other available breaching options (cutting torch, saw, rabbit tool, jam spreaders, ram, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Tactical Gas</h2>
        <p>Approval is needed when delivery systems other than individual aerosol dispersers are utilized. Possible chemical agents may include:</p>        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Oleoresin capsicum (OC)</li>
        <li>Orthochlorobenzalmalononitrile (CS)</li>
        <li>Hexachlorethane (HC) smoke</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Delivery systems may include:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Aerosol OC dispenser</li>
        <li>12 gauge shotgun and 40mm launcher</li>
        <li>White and colored smoke grenades</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Restrictions:</h2>
        <li>Pre-plan whose approval is required before use</li>
        <li>Large aerosol OC units with lock-down actuator and/or delivery tube for SWAT use only</li>
        <li>Pyrotechnic munitions such as projectiles, grenades, chemical smoke, etc., must only be used outdoors where danger of structural fire is reduced. Prior to use, local fire officials should be notified</li>

        <h1>Transportation Crash/Incident</h1>
        <p>In the immediate aftermath of a transportation crash, specialized agencies may become involved. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates catastrophic airplane crash sites and certain rail, highway, marine and pipeline accidents. The primary NTSB point of contact will be the assigned NTSB investigator in charge. In cases of suspected criminal activity, other agencies may participate in the investigation. The Safety Board does not investigate criminal activity; once it is established that a transportation tragedy is a criminal act, a law enforcement agency becomes the lead investigative body with the NTSB providing any requested support.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Checklist:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Establish contact with the NTSB via the NTSB Communication Center at (202)-314-6290. (24/7, non-public)</li>
        <li>Assign an investigator to work with the NTSB team during the on scene portion of the incident</li>
        <li>Local law enforcement agency interviews should be coordinated with the NTSB to avoid situations in which witnesses critical to the NTSB investigation are interviewed before NTSB subject matter experts have the opportunity to interview those witnesses</li>
        <li>Once NTSB is on the scene ensure protocols for proper and thorough exchange of factual information between the NTSB and the local law enforcement agency are implemented</li>
        <li>Ensure any public announcement (i.e. public tips, witnesses) be coordinated with the NTSB</li>

        <h1>Missing Child/Child Abduction Checklist</h1>
        <p>A report of a missing child can quickly expand into a full-scale investigation and search, complete with national news coverage. Studies have shown that of those children that are abducted and murdered, 74% are killed within three hours of the abduction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Wisconsin Department of Justice has prepared the Missing and Abducted Children – Response and Investigative Resource Guide. This comprehensive manual is available for download in the “Wisconsin Clearinghouse for Missing and Exploited Children and Adults” section of <a href="http://wilenet.org">WILENET</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Response and Investigative Resource Guide is intended to be used as a training manual, procedural and response guide, and resource handbook. Its information and checklists can be quickly accessed and used by patrol officers and supervisors, and it can also serve as a refresher for experienced investigators.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Consider requesting investigative assistance, crisis management expertise, and resources such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), WisDOJ Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI), and/or the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the facts of the missing child incident are within the guidelines, immediately activate your local, state, or regional Amber Alert. Consult <a href="http://wilenet.org">WILENET</a> for the current guidelines and necessary forms.</p>

        <h1>Officer Involved Shooting Incidents</h1>
        <p>The following is an excerpt from the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation Shooting Incident booklet published in June 2003. This checklist is intended to provide basic reminders for a supervisor at the scene of an officer-involved shooting incident.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Request medical assistance, if necessary, and notify dispatch</li>
        <li>Personally coordinate the investigation until an investigator arrives on the scene</li>
        <li>Secure the scene – establish crime/shooting scene perimeter and protect any evidence.</li>
        <li>No statement shall be compelled from affected officer(s)</li>
        <li>Request additional personnel as warranted</li>
        <li>Broadcast critical information to backup/responding units</li>
        <li>Avoid having involved officers conduct any investigation and/or interviews relevant to the shooting. Separate and remove involved officer(s) from the scene</li>
        <li>Identify, locate, and interview all personnel and witnesses at the scene</li>
        <li>Secure evidence</li>
        <li>Collect weapon(s) and ammunition from the involved officer(s).
        <ul><li>Whenever possible, provide officer(s) with replacement weapons as their weapons are seized.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Assign an officer or close friend to the involved officer(s). This officer should act as liaison between the involved officer, his/her family, and human resources to resolve difficulties which may arise concerning insurance benefits, leave, etc. Caution assigned personnel not to become involved in routine family activities</li>
        <li>If officer is injured, the officer’s family should be personally contacted and provided transportation with an informed officer to the treatment facility</li>
        <li>Ensure the involved officer’s family is personally briefed as soon as practical, by officer himself/herself, if circumstances permit</li>
        <li>In those situations where an officer is injured, locate a secluded area of the hospital where a liaison telephone can be set up and coordinated with hospital security authorities. Assign an officer to this location to coordinate the following</li>
        <ul><li>Security and privacy of the injured officer</li>
        <li>Media contacts through hospital public information office</li>
        <li>Interviews with law enforcement agencies, if necessary</li>
        <li>Visiting hours with office personnel to avoid overcrowding and uncomfortable situations</li>
        <li>Inquiries from other agencies</li></ul></li>
        <li>Ensure additional evidentiary items are properly secured at the hospital (e.g. clothing)</li>
        <li>Consider interview of involved officer(s) by someone sensitized in the area of post critical incident trauma.</li>
        <li>Every effort should be made to ensure that any statements required to be made by an officer are given after the officer has been afforded reasonable time to regain composure and is capable of understanding his/her rights</li>
        <li>Arrange for a daily briefing of the injured officer, if necessary</li>
        <li>Brief media personnel, being careful not to release the officer’s name</li>
        <li>Consideration should be given as to which agency should make press releases (if/when multiple agencies are involved), whether or not the subject’s identity should be released, and whether the identity of the subject’s next of kin should be released</li>
        <li>Keep office personnel apprised of the investigation and the condition of any injured officer(s)</li>
        <li>Screen all phone calls at the office of the involved officer. The same precaution may be necessary at the officer’s residence</li>
        <li>Provide appropriate security for the officer’s home and family</li>
        <li>Ensure contact has been initiated between the involved officer(s) and the EAP representative</li>
        <li>Receive briefing concerning post-critical incident trauma</li>
        <li>Coordinate availability of peer support</li>
        <li>Review Workers Compensation Benefits for questions relating to work-related illnesses and injuries</li>
        <li>In situations where an officer has sustained damage to personal property, consult agency policy</li>
        </ul>
